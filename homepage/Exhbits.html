<h2 class=title>The Museum</h2>
<div class= essay>
<p>The American Museum of Natural History was founded in 1869 and is located on 220 Broadway in the City of New York. The museum was built even before the NYC subway was a thing, and mind you, New Yorkers do nothing but complain how ancient those subways carts are. All of the people who built the city from the ground are most likely six feet underground at this point. Nevertheless,this place has been there to see how the city gained its essence throughout the years.</p>
<p>This place is the target of every middle school science trip. Personally, I never really went on a field trip to this museum, which adds a little spark to my whole experience if you were to ask me. Unlike other kids, I got here on my own. No cheesy bus that dropped me off at the entrance or some teacher to follow. However, my purpose here was academic-related. I will not lie and pretend I go here because I like to spend three hours after school at a place full of tourists because it's not like any New Yorker in their sane mind would want to spend a Monday afternoon here. After school, I have a program, so I am forced to get on the B train to 81st street and go up the long set of stairs to realize I left my ID at home and would then have to deal with the security guard not wanting to let me in. Like I said before, I only come here for academic purposes, but this place has become another land for me. As the name of this place implies, this museum is full of history, but in my perspective, the history I see goes beyond the exhibitions of dissected animals. </p>
 <p>There are about four entrances and four different floors. The outside is very bland but not dull enough to ignore it as you go down Broadway. The inside is where it gets interesting. I know I get it - there are many dissected animals throughout the museum, and let's not even forget about the giant whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling that you see in every movie. But here is what you don't know: each corner has an opportunity for you to embrace your Alice in Wonderland fantasy.
</p>
  <p>There is a big terrace next to the Hayden Planetarium. I do not know if it is open to the public because, with my museum ID, I can open any door, and sometimes I open doors I am not supposed to open. The terrace is humongous; it overlooks both Central Park and 81st. During the winter months, the best thing is to go there around 5:00 pm, when it's dark out, and the big ball in the planetarium is lighting up a bright blue color and gives off Rockefeller Center vibes. You go there, sit down in the middle of the field, and see the different people and their dogs walking by the minipark that's across the street. You look to the left, and you will see little kids from the planetarium pointing at you to their moms, probably wondering what you are doing there. Then 5:20 pm comes around, and you will start hearing the loudspeaker in fifty different languages telling people that the museum will close in exactly ten minutes. However, I always like to linger around longer until one of the security guards comes to the terrace and yells at me that the museum is closed. Still, I show him my museum ID (this ID technically gives me employee benefits), and gives me a frowny face and walks away. As I headed out one time, I think the security guard, Mark - I eventually learned his name - turned the sprinklers on, so I was running across the field like a mad man, and when I got to the end, he was in his corner, and we exchanged smiles. Will you experience this at another museum? Probably not.
If you come here on Fridays and stay late enough, you will see people in the main lobby walking down on extravagant gowns because there's always some charity event. I like to sit in the middle of it next to the FDR statue- Teddy. Then meticulously analyze every fancy person that walks past by and guess what they do for a living. Will you see this at another museum? Maybe but different people so it won't be the same.
</p>
<p>What makes this place exceptional is not the special exhibits that it has or its architecture; it is the experiences you gain from your visits. My experience at the Natural Museum of History is unique to me, but the magical thing about this place is that it allows everyone to gain special unremarkable moments.
